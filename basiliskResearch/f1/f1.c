# Mercedes-AMG F1 W09's aerodynamics

In this code, we will attempt to simulate the flow around Lewis Hamilton's
[W09](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-AMG_F1_W09_EQ_Power%2B), 2018's F1
world championship winning car. Its manufacturer is the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1
team.

To this end, we use the centered Navier-Stokes solver in a monophasic
configuration.

## Main function

The largest dimension of the W09 is its length $L\simeq 5 \ m$. Although it can
achieve maximum speeds a bit shy of $400\ km/h$, we rein in this temple of speed
to a mere $U = 180 \ km/h$. The resulting Reynolds number is approximately
$2.5\times10^7$. The computed kolmogorv scale is thus $\eta=L\times
Re^{-3/4}\simeq 15 \ \mu m$. This DNS is therefore far from being well resolved,
and is merely a proof of concept of the aerodynamics of an F1 car.
